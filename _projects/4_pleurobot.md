This project focuses on developing firmware and communication systems for the sensorized **Pleurobot**, a bio-inspired robot mimicking the locomotion of the salamander _Pleurodeles waltl_. The project was conducted at **BIOROB - EPFL**, under the supervision of Prof. *Auke Jan Ijspeert* and Dr. *Qiyuan Fu*.

## Objectives

1. **Sensor Modules**: Optimize sampling speed, robustness and communication of sensor modules to the onboard computer.
2. **Wireless Control**: Enable remote operation via a user-friendly interface.
3. **Integrate Visualization Tools**: Develop real-time monitoring using ROS2 and RViz.

### Sensor modules


- **Original System**: Relied on a centralized bus controller for communication, leading to latency and bottlenecks. The bus controller was connected to sensor modules (Raspberry Pi Pico) via RS485.

- **Redesigned Communication system and protocol**: Eliminated the bus controller by directly connecting the **Raspberry Pi 5** with sensor modules (Raspberry Pi Pico).
- **Custom Protocol**: Developed a custom communication protocol for real-time data transmission and synchronization. The custom protocol is based on a token-ring communication, where each sensor module sends data in a round-robin fashion.

This approach allowed for faster communication and reduced latency, enabling real-time control and monitoring.

The latency was reduced from 26 ms to 3 ms, assuming 20 sensor modules on the same bus.
### ROS2 Integration

The software stack was integrated into the ROS2 ecosystem, enabling modularity, scalability, and real-time visualization.

- **Packages**: Custom ROS2 packages for managing robot control, sensor communication, and visualization.
- **Visualization**: Leveraged RViz for real-time monitoring of force data and sensor states.
- **Launch Files**: Simplified system startup and configuration.

### Demonstrations

1. **Transparent Force Reproduction**
    - Data from the front-right legâ€™s force sensors was filtered and mapped to reproduce forces on the hind-right leg in real time.
    - Showcased proportional control and smooth feedback.

2. **Safe Movement with Force Threshold**
    - Implemented a safety mechanism that stops movement if excessive force is detected.
    - Used hysteresis to prevent frequent interruptions.

## Results and Future Work

- **Results**:
    - Achieved very low-latency and high sampling rate communication over RS485 bus.
    - Successfully integrated the Pleurobot into the ROS2 ecosystem.
    - Organization of development environment and codebase using Git and Docker.

- **Future Improvements**:
    - Develop a custom PCB for the Raspberry Pi 5 for cleaner hardware integration.
    - Enhance visualization integrating the complete URDF kinematic model.
    - Explore advanced microcontroller options (e.g., RP2350, ESP32) for improved performance.
    - Integrate the sensor modules (3-layer PCB) into a single board for compactness and reliability.
